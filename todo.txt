What has to be done?

[X] - Add dependencies and print hello world.
[X] - Let's start by fetching the events from one of the pages. Ignore the month, pagination, etc.
[X] - Gather some info from the events - name, date, location, has multiple sessions, etc.
[X] - Start fetching based on the month. For now lets fetch the events from the current month and the two next months.
[X] - Start fetching based on the pagination. It can be done through the 'page' queryParam, and do requests and page=x doesn't retrieve any values (i guess it works).
[X] - If the event has multiple sessions, it should open the details page and fetch more info. use the href to open the details page. 
[ ] - Get all the dates for this especific event after opening the details page.
[ ] - Connect to the giggz DB.
[ ] - I dont want to store all the events, only the ones i have stored in the standup table.
[ ] - Check if current event was already created. combination of name and date already exists
[ ] - Search if the event location already exists in DB. If not, create it.  
[ ] - Get the comedians from the title. Check wether this is feasible or not
[ ] - Store all the events in the DB with all the gathered data.
