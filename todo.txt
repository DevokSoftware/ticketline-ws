What has to be done?

[X] - Add dependencies and print hello world.
[X] - Let's start by fetching the events from one of the pages. Ignore the month, pagination, etc.
[X] - Gather some info from the events - name, date, location, has multiple sessions, etc.
[X] - Start fetching based on the month. For now lets fetch the events from the current month and the two next months.
[X] - Start fetching based on the pagination. It can be done through the 'page' queryParam, and do requests and page=x doesn't retrieve any values (i guess it works).
[X] - If the event has multiple sessions, it should open the details page and fetch more info. use the href to open the details page. 
[X] - Get all the dates for this especific event after opening the details page.
[X] - Connect to the giggz DB.
[X] - I dont want to store all the events, only the ones i have stored in the standup table.
[X] - Check if current event was already created. combination of name and date already exists
[X] - Search if the event location already exists in DB. If not, add log to insert it later in DB.  
[ ] - Get the comedians from the title. Check wether this is feasible or not
[X] - Store all the events in the DB with all the gathered data.
